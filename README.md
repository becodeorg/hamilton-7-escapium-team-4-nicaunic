HTML, CSS & SASS.

## **What was the easiest part ?**
* **Lauranne Nicolas :** Creating my own pages
* **Nicolas Bussière :** Doing the responsive of the blogs section
* **Aurélie Van Hellemont :** Copying HTML and doing basic CSS without Sass

## **What was the hardest part ?**
* **Lauranne Nicolas:** Manage the conflicts and working in other's codes
* **Nicolas Bussière:** Sass of the header part
* **Aurélie Van Hellemont:** The structure of BEM classes with Sass, the responsive, and Git problems

**P.S.:** We did not finish this project. Also, we made a mock-up for each page in paper format, it hasn't been inclued in our files but we thought it was interesting to mention it. 

Some works in progress are still on the personal branchs and are not merged because there were too much conflicts and it would have ruined our previous work, therefore they do not appear in "main" and neither on the page's links.  

**Here's the link to our Trello:** [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/uyYWwZhs/ATTIb9871d84d557de6e60c2f89aa89adf0dBF66AC6D/avancement)  
We also made a Discord server to organize ourselves with the possibility of pin messages, so that's why there's is nothing in our team voice chat in Becode's Discord.
